The elefunds donation plug-in, developed by elefunds GmbH, is part of the payment process to provide you with the chance to round up a freely eligible donation amount aside your invoice. The up-rounding can be donated to any displayed organisation according to your choice.\n\nBy activating the elefunds Plugins you declare approval to the addition of your donation onto your purchase bill. It will appear as a single amount. The donation does not include any VAT.\n\nThe rounded up donation amount is collected in the name and on account of elefunds foundation public trust UG (Limited) which will forward this amount (100%) without any deduction to one or more organisation of your (the donators) choice. The donation amount listed on your bill is not a donation receipt in the sense of tax laws. You can simply check the box before exiting the online shop or contact us to get a regular donation receipt.\n\nIn the course of your donation the Plugin, developed and distributed by elefunds GmbH, does not save any personal data like (e-mail) - addresses, names or dates of purchase. It solely saves time of day and date of your donation as well as the amount of your donation to one or more organisations.\n\nIf you have any questions around the subject area ""online shop donations via elefunds"" or the ""elefunds online shop"" please do not hesitate to pick up contact to the elefunds GmbH.\n\nelefunds GmbH\nSch√∂nhauser Allee 124\n10437 Berlin\nPhone: +49 30 484 924 38\nFax: +49 30 484 924 24\ncontact@elefunds.de
