elefunds API SDK v2.0.0
=======================

Welcome to the elefunds API SDK.

Be sure to checkout the the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/elefunds/elefunds-SDK/blob/master/Documentation/GettingStarted.md)
for a general introduction to the elefunds API, before moving on to the language of your choice.

The API itself is (naturally) language agnostic, but the SDKs are a great help and timesaver!

We have additional resources, that can drastically reduce the amount of work you have to do when implementing:

- a JavaScript SDK that takes care of a great amount of logic for various scenarios and that is useful for all kind of 
  browser-based use cases

- a PHP SDK that wrap most of the logic for backend processes and provides helper classes for logic that needs to be 
  implemented from your side. The PHP SDK itself uses the JavaScript SDK.

Best,  
the elefunds team
